‘Walls’ project is a social network, it is a website built keeping in mind
user-interactiveness and responsiveness for almost all commonly used devices.
Any individual with an email ID can register on the platform, create Wall(s) which
are based on some interest or topic, post content, interact with other users’
posts, and even chat with other users.

This whole project is designed and built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Php
Laravel Framework, PostgreSQL and Bootstrap and font-awesome are also
used for the development of this project. This project has almost all basic
features of any social networking platform and some implemented in our own
way, which makes the platform stand out among others.
